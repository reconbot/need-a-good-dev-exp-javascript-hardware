Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.

#6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

#7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

#16: What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they donâ€™t succeed? Stack the odds against.

Once upon a time there was arduino. Every day people downloaded zip files off of forum posts. Because of that we had the same problems over and over, we couldn't build on each other's work, we couldn't even organize. Until finally node on embedded hardware!

Once upon a time there was nodejs on Single Board Computers, every day people used node 0.10 and node 0.12 and spend hours managing Linux. Because of that people thought this was really hard to do, ran away from it, said "Arduino is enough because I understand that", Until finally Tessel 2.

Once upon a time it was very hard and expensive to start working with hardware. Every day people who had trained for years would make things for everyone else to use. Because of that we had very little diversity and growth in what was bing made and who it was made for. Until finally we had cheap approach able hardware.

Once upon a time we had cheap available hardware made for the people who have been making hardware for years. Every day web developers would try to program for the hardware but would hit many, many obstacles. Because of that very few people could get started, Easy to use choices were limited and it was very difficult to do complex things with devices. Until finally NodeJS on hardware.

Once upon a time companies wanted to take their hardware online. Every day firmware developers were asked to add "web" to their products. Because of that they added web the only way they knew how, by using c and c++, and they opened devices who have always worked in isolation to the entire Internet. Because of that we have a new world of risk, things that used to work fine are misbehaving both by accident and by malicious intent, unable to function appropriately in the world of the web. Until finally we were able to provide a way for developers versed in the web to use web technologies to control products.


# different story
Once upon a time I wanted to get more people behind the notion that nodejs provides a great way to get devices online. Every day I struggled to make to communicate this to incumbent device makers, our firmware works fine! they said. JS doesn't run on low powered devices they said! Because of that we had a lot of high profile hacks, app development remained difficult and primarily in c++ and only people who already knew how to make firmware based applications could make applications that ran on devices. Because of that we had an Internet of shit. Until finally we decided to go bottom up and start with you.
